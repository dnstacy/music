Thomas has claimed that I made the assertion that Mastermind was written ironically. I do not remember making this statement, but I don't doubt that I said something along those lines. That being said, I resent the light that my statement was presented in. I have to believe that Taylor is being ironic with her lyrics in Mastermind because otherwise, they're extremely over the top and it takes away from the enjoyment of the song. It feels like a little smile and wink at the camera because Taylor is clearly a schemer; it's how she has remained relevant for over a decade now, but it's also like she's poking fun at herself by overexaggerating the scheming she's guilty of. Additionally, it is funny to me that Taylor has written Mastermind after she gave us Invisible String on Folklore. On this track, Taylor sings about how something beyond their control has brought her and her love together. Mastermind, however, compeletely obliterates this fanciful idea. I think Mastermind is the antithesis of Invisible String, so it is ironic that she would make a song that really contradicts the ideas she has already expressed in a song released just a couple of years ago. In this analysis, I make no statement on my preference of one song over the other. I only wanted to defend my name against the harsh light that Thomas painted me in with his own analysis of the album.


The ex that Taylor is singing about on Would've, Could've, Should've is John Mayer. He was 32 and she was 19 when they dated, and she released this song as the 19th track on the album she made when she was 32 - Machiavellian. But also, it is generally expected that Speak Now is the next album that Taylor will re-release, and Speak Now is the album that Taylor released after her breakup with Mayer. Listen to Dear John for a classic Taylor takedown of an ex, but we also expect some tracks to be released from the vault that get after Mayer maybe even more than Dear John (think the 10 minute version of All Too Well for Jake Gyllenhaal).


This brings me to my final point. There was some talk about the fifth track of Midnights - You're On Your Own, Kid. There was question of whether the sentiment of the song was positive or negative, and don't let me tell you how to listen to a song, but there is a theme across most of Taylor's albums: a devastating track 5. In her own words, "I didnâ€™t realize I was doing this, but as I was making albums, I guess I was just kind of putting a very vulnerable, personal, honest, emotional song as track five. So because you noticed this, I kind of started to put the songs that were really honest, emotional, vulnerable, and personal as track five." Also, Taylor's bridges are some of her strongest songwriting. The bridge of You're Own Your Own, Kid is no exception. With that bridge and the fact that this is track 5, this song is a heartbreaker to me.
